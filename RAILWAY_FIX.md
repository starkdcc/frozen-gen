# 🛠️ Railway Deployment Fix Applied!

## ❌ Issue Identified:
```
PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined function mysqli_connect()
```

## ✅ Solution Applied:

### 1. **Custom Dockerfile Created**
- Added PHP mysqli extension
- Configured Apache properly
- Set correct permissions

### 2. **Railway Config Updated**
- Now uses custom Dockerfile instead of auto-detection
- Ensures mysqli extension is available

### 3. **Files Updated & Pushed to GitHub**
- ✅ `Dockerfile` - PHP 8.2 with mysqli extension
- ✅ `railway.yml` - Updated to use Dockerfile
- ✅ `.htaccess` - Fixed DirectoryIndex to index.php

---

## 🚂 Next Steps:

1. **Railway will auto-redeploy** from the GitHub push
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the new container to build
3. **Check your Railway dashboard** - should show "Building" then "Deployed"
4. **Test your app** - the mysqli error should be resolved

## 🎯 What Changed:

**Before**: Railway used FrankenPHP (missing mysqli)
**After**: Custom Docker container with PHP 8.2 + Apache + mysqli

Your Frozen Gen app should now work properly with the database connection!

**Status**: ✅ Fix deployed - Railway rebuilding now
