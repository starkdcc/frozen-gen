# ðŸš‚ Deploy Frozen Gen to Railway

## ðŸš€ **Quick Railway Deployment Guide**

### **Step 1: Prepare GitHub Repository**
1. Create a new repository on GitHub: `frozen-gen`
2. Upload **ALL** files from `F:\frozen-gen-deploy\` to your GitHub repository
3. Make sure all files are committed and pushed

### **Step 2: Create Railway Account**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with your GitHub account
3. Verify your account

### **Step 3: Deploy Database First**
1. In Railway Dashboard, click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Provision MySQL"**

5. **Copy these values** (you'll need them):
   - `MYSQL_HOST`
   - `MYSQL_USER` 
   - `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
   - `MYSQL_DATABASE`

### **Step 4: Deploy Application**
1. Click **"New Project"** â†’ **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
2. Select your `frozen-gen` repository
3. Railway will automatically detect it's a PHP application
4. Wait for initial deployment

### **Step 5: Configure Environment Variables**
1. Click on your **web service** â†’ **"Variables"** tab
2. Add these environment variables:
   ```
   DB_HOST = [Your MYSQL_HOST from step 3]
   DB_USER = [Your MYSQL_USER from step 3]
   DB_PASS = [Your MYSQL_PASSWORD from step 3]
   DB_NAME = [Your MYSQL_DATABASE from step 3]
   ```

### **Step 6: Import Database Schema**
1. **Option A: Using Railway CLI** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   # Install Railway CLI
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   
   # Login to Railway
   railway login
   
   # Connect to your MySQL service
   railway connect mysql
   
   # Import the schema
   source database-schema.sql
   ```

2. **Option B: Using MySQL Client**
   - Use the connection details from Variables tab
   - Connect with any MySQL client (phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, etc.)
   - Import `database-schema.sql`

### **Step 7: Test Your Deployment**
